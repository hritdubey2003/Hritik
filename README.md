In future, I am willing to design a much interactive and impressive UI for this. Also, I want to add an extra portion of the automatic email generator to the site using which every visitor who wants to get in touch with me will get autogenerated email received at its email that Your queries will be resolved very shortly. 
Also, I want to add a dashboard page where any person visiting my website can login and have a live chat session with me. For that, I am working over at socket.io.
